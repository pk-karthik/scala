t4749.scala:27: warning: Fail6 has a main method with parameter type Array[String], but bippy.Fail6 will not be a runnable program.
  Reason: companion contains its own main method (implementation restriction: no main is allowed, regardless of signature), which means no static forwarder can be generated.
